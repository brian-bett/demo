## introduction to programming

My name is Brian Kipchirchir and i love software development.
Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.
Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable.
thank you!
